## Top 10 Shortcuts (Categorised)

### Navigation
1. **Quick Open files:** `Ctrl+P` (**⌘P**) — Jump to any file by name without leaving the keyboard.  
2. **Go to Symbol in file:** `Ctrl+Shift+O` (**⌘Shift+O**) — Search functions, classes, and headings in the current file.  
3. **Go to Line:** `Ctrl+G` (**⌘G**) — Move directly to a specific line number.  

### Editing (incl. Multi‑cursor)
4. **Add cursor (multi‑cursor):** `Alt+Click` (**Option+Click**) — Place multiple cursors for parallel edits.  
5. **Add cursor above/below:** `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` (**⌥⌘Up/Down**) — Stack cursors vertically across lines.  
6. **Select next occurrence (multi‑edit):** `Ctrl+D` (**⌘D**) — Add the next match of the current selection.  
7. **Select all occurrences:** `Ctrl+Shift+L` (**⌘Shift+L**) — Select every match at once for bulk edits.  
8. **Move line up/down:** `Alt+Up/Down` (**Option+Up/Down**) — Reorder lines quickly.  
   <!-- (If you prefer duplication over moving, use: Duplicate line: Shift+Alt+Down (**Shift+Option+Down**) ) -->
9. **Toggle line comment:** `Ctrl+/` (**⌘/**) — Comment/uncomment instantly while coding.  

### Debugging
10. **Start/Continue debugging:** `F5` — Run or continue the current debug session.

## Reflection

### Which shortcuts will be most useful daily?
- **Quick Open (`Ctrl+P` / ⌘P)**: Fastest way to jump files, especially in larger repos.  
- **Multi‑cursor tools**: `Alt+Click`, `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` (⌥⌘Up/Down), and `Ctrl+D` (⌘D) let me make consistent edits across many lines at once (e.g., renaming variables, adding arguments, editing JSON lists).  
- **Go to Symbol (`Ctrl+Shift+O` / ⌘Shift+O)**: Essential for navigating long files by functions or classes.  
- **Toggle line comment (`Ctrl+/` / ⌘/)**: Speeds up experimentation and explaining code in reviews.  
- **Integrated terminal toggle (`` Ctrl+` `` / ⌘`)**: Keeps me in the flow while running tests and git commands.

### How do keyboard shortcuts improve productivity?
- **Reduce context switching**: Staying on the keyboard cuts down time lost moving between mouse, editor, and terminal.  
- **Faster bulk edits**: Multi‑cursor + multi‑select turns repetitive changes into a few keystrokes.  
- **Lower cognitive load**: Muscle memory builds over time, so routine actions become automatic.  
- **Fewer micro‑interruptions**: Quick navigation (files, symbols, lines) means less scrolling/searching, more focused problem‑solving.  
- **Better debugging flow**: F5/F9 allow quick iterative runs and breakpoint management.
